                    <br>

                    This was mitigated through the use of the <code>IsNumeric</code> function, which means the <code>calculateTotalCost</code><br>
                    function is only run when input can be resolved as valid.

                    (If can be used as a function in VB.NET) was used to evaluate an edge case when the program attempted to
                    expand an empty list to toppings. Because of the string splicing used, the program could potentially break.
                    However, with this implementation, the program will return a default value of <code>No toppings selected</code>

                    I decided to do it on submit, rather than on change, or on field exit, because those are really annoying when you get the popup boxes while trying to edit other things.<br>

                    The quantity field will also be validated as an Integer rather than Numeric, because Numeric would still validate the input 1.5, and you can't have half a pizza.

                    the program will provide a popup message box asking the user if they want to set delivery time to exactly 20 mins from now.

                    Don't run update cost funcs while form being reset. I used the debugging functionality of Visual Studio to help preview the values of variables as they change.<br>

                    A runtime error (infinite recursion error) was appearing when the form was being reset via code. The error was occurring where the form was being reset, meaning the <code>TextChanged</code>
                    handlers were running, updating the costs, running the handlers, updating the costs, etc, and the program crashed in an infinite loop. This was fixed by adding a boolean <code>resetting</code>
                    to only run the update cost functions when the form isn't in the stage of being reset

                    A popup box will appear if the user tries to submit the form with no toppings, assuming it to be a mistake. It does, however, allow them to proceed if they're gross and like margarita.
                    Phone numbers are mainly validated through a masked textbox, allowing for Australian mobile phone numbers in the format <code>04xx-xxx-xxx</code><br>

                    The postcode is validated through the use of a regular expression, fitting four digits. It's pretty simple, but effective.

                    The quantity field will be validated as an integer of value at least one, through the use of a regular expression. If the user has attempted to order more than 30 pizzas for some reason,
                    the program will confirm with them that they really want to order that many<br>
                    A max length of two characters on the text box also applies.
